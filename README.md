# Cost Sharing for YNAB
Check out the live website and app here! https://costsharingforynab.com. Cost Sharing for YNAB is an open-source React web application built to work with YNAB (You Need a Budget), integrating with the YNAB API. YNAB members can use this add-on app, secured with HTTPS, to split shared expenses 50/50 with a partner while keeping track of the original expense breakdown in their budget. Members authenticate with their existing YNAB credentials via OAuth, allowing the app to connect securely to their account. While building this app I took the opportunity to experiment in a few new technologies, including React Hooks on the front end, and hosting the app on my own Linux-based Raspberry Pi (with Node and systemd) on the back end - although needing to reset everything after power outages got old, so I transitioned to hosting the app on AWS :). I'm excited to contribute this add-on feature to the YNAB community!
