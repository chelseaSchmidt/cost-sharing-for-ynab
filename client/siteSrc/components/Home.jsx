        <p className="description">
          Hi! My name is Chelsea, and I&apos;m the creator of Cost Sharing for YNAB.
          To help you understand why you might use this web app, I&apos;ll walk through
          a use case - my own! My partner and I use a shared credit card for all
          our communal expenses, such as utilities, groceries, gas, and restaurants.
          Since the credit card is in my name and syncing to my YNAB account, I
          track 100% of the shared card&apos;s expenses in my own YNAB budget during the month,
          and then at the end of the month my partner pays me back 50%. During the month
          I record transactions to their respective expense categories contained under
          one overarching category group called &quot;Shared Expenses,&quot; like this:
        </p>
        <img
          src="YNAB-shared-categories.png"
          alt="Screenshot of 'Shared Expenses' category group and sub-categories"
          width="189px"
          height="432px"
          id="shared-expense-img"
        />
        <p className="description">
          At the end of each month, I credit half of all those expenses back to my
          partner in an IOU account from him to me, and he pays me back that amount
          (or we just keep a running tab open).
        </p>
        <p className="description">
          This is simple enough to do in YNAB if you&apos;re not interested in keeping
          track of the original expense categories for each shared cost - you
          could just track everything in one category called &quot;shared costs&quot; and
          then charge half to the IOU account each month. On the other hand, you
          could lose a lot of visibility into your spending trends over time.
        </p>
        <p className="description">
          My personal preference is to track all incoming shared costs in their
          different categories, and to charge back to the IOU account half of each
          category, to accurately portray where my dollars are really going each
          month. As you can imagine, this can be a pain when you have a lot of
          shared cost categories to keep track of. That&apos;s where Cost Sharing for
          YNAB comes in!

        <div className="subtitle">INSTRUCTIONS</div>
        <ol className="description">
          <li>
            Open the web app by selecting the button below, or in the menu at the
            top right of the screen. You will be redirected to a YNAB authorization
            screen to enter your credentials.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optional: select one or more YNAB banking accounts that you use for
            shared costs, such as a shared credit card, if your situation is
            similar to the example above. If you don&apos;t use any one account
            specifically for shared costs, don&apos;t worry about this step.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select one or more category&nbsp;
            <em>groups</em>
            &nbsp;that contain shared-cost budget categories. Individual categories
            cannot be selected at this time, only entire groups.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select a YNAB account you want to use as an IOU account representing
            what the other person owes back to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select a date range over which you want to view transactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            After hitting &quot;Show Transactions,&quot; you will see a list of all your YNAB
            transactions in the budget categories and banking accounts you designated,
            over the specified time period.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you selected one or more shared banking accounts, the app will shows
            yellow warning symbols if a transaction has been included in a shared
            budget category but isn&apos;t present in the shared banking account, or
            vice versa. These can be ignored if you don&apos;t use a specific credit
            card or banking account for your shared expenses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select all or some of the shared cost transactions, and hit the &quot;Split
            Selected Transactions&quot; button to create a  single summary transaction
            in your YNAB budget that moves half the amount from each affected budget
            category to the IOU account.
